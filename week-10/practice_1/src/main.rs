fn main() {

   //vector v owns the object in heap

   //only a single variable owns the heap memory at any given time
   let _v2 = v.clone(); //here, there would have an error without cloning the vector

   //here two variables owns heap value
   //two pointers to the same content is not allowed in rust

   //Rust is very smart in terms of memory access, so it detects a race condition
   //as two variables point to the same heap

   println!("{:?}",v); //now this will print because there is not transfer of ownership
